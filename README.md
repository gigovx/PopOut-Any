Poput-Any was designed to hide windows that I use often but hate to have in the taskbar. 
<br>
For example Co-Pilot, I can now leave this running and when I want it, I simply slide my cursor over the edge of the screen and it pops out.
<br>
Made entirely using Co-Pilot, including the graphics. There are issues. But it does work.
<br>
Usage:<br>
Select the app from the list, it will only detect apps that are currently visible on the screen, if it's minimised it won't detect it, select refresh to refresh the list of apps.<br>
Select the edge you want it to pop/slide out from, currently: Top Left, Top Right, Right Top, Right Bottom, Bottom Left, Bottom Right, Left Bottom, Left Top.<br>
Choose your Interval, Steps, Dwell (delay) (default values are normally decent enough)<br>
Choose and animation, not needed but a fading transparent effect makes it look nicer<br>
Assign the Window, go back and repeat for any more you want to add<br>
Finally Enable Edge Trigger, this will enable the functions, the window(s) will then slide off the screen, feel free to close PopOut-Any and it will go to the System Tray.<br>

Known Issues<br>
If the app crashes, your windows can sometime become lost off the screen, normally a forced closure and a restart will solve the issue of not being able to see the app.<br>
Only works on your Primary Monitor, I have not test with multiple screens.<br>
